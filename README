This is an open-source template for DJing with Ableton Live 8 with an Akai APC40. You are welcome to do whatever you want with it: perform, distribute, modify, etc.

IMPORTANT: A video explaining how this template works and how it can be used can be found at http://www.vimeo.com/6993740

Watch it before doing anything else!

This template requires the full version of Ableton Live 8. It is best to upgrade to the latest version (currently 8.2.2), as there are stability issues with previous versions.

If you don't own an APC, you could readily map this template to whatever controller you have.

If you have any issues getting this working, feel free to drop me a message.
